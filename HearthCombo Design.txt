My website is about Hearthstone combos

HearthCombo

Here at HearthCombo's, we focus on the video game Hearthstone, designed by Blizzard Entertainment.
Our target audience are those that are already familiar with game and play either casually or competitively.
The main focus of our site will be on the synergy between two or more cards at a time.
We will explain what is needed for the interaction to be pulled off, how it is done, and how effective it is.
Do note that not all combos we discuss will be competitive, but we hope to strike a nice balance between the
effective and the highly situational.

Some combos are more clear cut than others, they will be straight forward and not much will need to be said.
In these instances, we will try to cover as much as possible by using different catalysts. A simple example,
is Chromaggus, an 8 mana minion that has the ability to add a copy of any card you draw. Naturally, we would
look into any cards that cost 2 or less mana and that let us draw a card on the turn that Chromaggus is played.
Chromaggus + Rogue's Shiv would work, so would Chromaggus + Warlock's Mortal Coil + A minion already in play with 1 Health.
