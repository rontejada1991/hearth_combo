        <p>Here at HearthCombo, we focus on the video game <a href="http://us.battle.net/hearthstone/en/" target="_blank">Hearthstone</a>, designed by <a href="http://us.blizzard.com/en-us/" target="_blank">Blizzard Entertainment</a>. Our target audience are those that are already familiar with the game and play either casually or competitively. The main focus of our site will be on discussion of the synergy between two or more cards at a time. We will explain what is needed for the interaction to be pulled off, how it is done, and how effective it is. Do note that not all combos we discuss will be competitive, but we hope to strike a nice balance between the effective and the situational.</p>

        <p>Some combos are more clear cut than others, they will be straight forward and not much will need to be said. In these instances, we will try to cover as much as possible by using different catalysts. A simple example is <a href="http://hearthstone.gamepedia.com/Chromaggus">Chromaggus</a>, an 8 mana minion that has the ability to add a copy of any card you draw. Naturally, we would look into any cards that cost 2 or less mana (since we are only allowed a maximum of 10 mana) and that let us draw a card on the turn that it is played. Chromaggus + <a href="http://hearthstone.gamepedia.com/Shiv">Shiv</a> would work, so would Chromaggus + <a href="http://hearthstone.gamepedia.com/Mortal_Coil">Mortal Coil</a> + A minion already in play with 1 Health.</p>

    <p>A combo entry will answer the following:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>What cards are required?</li>
      <li>How much mana is required?</li>
      <li>How is this combo performed?</li>
      <li>What does this combo accomplish?</li>
      <li>Is this combo worth it for constructed play?</li>
    </ul>
